Q1

O(n); the time complexity is N as there is a single loop that will
go on for N amount on times depending on the input

******************************

Q2

O(log N); is the time complexity of this algorithm as the input size
is halved each

******************************

Q3

O(n); is the time complexity of this algorithm as there is two loops that will go on N amount of times depending on the input site

******************************

Q4

O(log N); is the time complexity of this algorithm as the while loop will go around N times but it cut in half the amount of loops each time it goes around

*****************************

Q5

O(n^2); is the time complexity of this algorithm as there is a loop that goes around N times and a nested loops that will go N times everytime the parent loop goes once

*****************************

Q6

O(2^n); is the time complexity of this algorithm as each iteration of this recursive loop will call it self twice for each input

ADT (abstract data type) <-------- lists stacks etc
has methologies that we dont define
** are preset in a class **

Top stack
can include any data 

------------------------------------------------

in python we manipulate lists into stacks

cant use original data structure methods when you make a class
only defined methods can be used

****example****
	we cant use .append()
	on a stack made from a list

-----------------------------------------------

Deques is a double sided Queue
can be popped from top or bot

D.add_first(e): add element at front of Deque D position 0
D.add_last(e)  			^ but the end
D.delete_first() remove and return the first element from Deque
D.delete_last() remove and return the last elemnt form Deque

rest of defs are the same as for other data types

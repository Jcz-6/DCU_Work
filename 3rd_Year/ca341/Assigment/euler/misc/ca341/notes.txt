1. What is Project Euler?
   https://projecteuler.net/
   https://projecteuler.net/problem=1

2. What is Einstein/euler?
   https://euler.computing.dcu.ie/

3. You will have to:
   1. pick an euler problem
   2. pick a programming language

4. git setup:
   - fork euler project (link above)
   - clone locally
   - pick a task name:
     e.g. euler-1-multiples-of-3-or-5.c

     - copy the style of existing names
     - use "-" as a separator, or "_" if absolutely necessary

   - create a suitably-named branch (e.g. you task name!)

5. create Einstein marker:
   - in problems/$YOUR_TASK_NAME
   - your solution
   - your task description
   - your test cases

7. Einstein infrastructure
   ...
   Examples...

   add-three-numbers.py
     - one integer command-line argument
     - one integer read from standard input
     - one integer read from a file named "data.txt"
     - add them and write the sum to standard output

     - note... testing locally

   euler-1-multiples-of-3-or-5.c

8. push your new branch back to GitLab
   create a merge request
   check CI

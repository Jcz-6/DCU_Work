# Wrapper script for compiling and running C uploads to Einstein.
#
# Einstein defaults to using this script to build and run C uploads.
# You don't have to use this script; if you include your own "runner.zsh"
# or "runner.sh", then that will be run instead.

# Take care here to preserve stdin.
# We don't want any of the commands below (notably gcc) consuming it.

# Fail and exit immediately if any of the commands below fail.
#
set -e

# Extract the base name for this task.  Einstein sets the environment
# variable TASK, so we extract the base name from that.
#
# E.g.... "test.c" -> "test".
#
base=${TASK%.c}

# Guard against a lecturer inadvertently leaving a copy of the executable in
# their marker directory.
#
if [[ -f $base ]]
then
   rm $base
fi

# Compile the upload:
#
#   - we redirect stdin because we don't want gcc to consume it here, and
#   - we include the maths library because one/some of Donal's tasks use it.
#
# Note this: -std=c11
#  and this: -Werror
#            (all warnings are converted to errors; see stderr to fix the problem)
#
gcc -std=c11 -Werror -o $base -l m $TASK < /dev/null

# Shift the name of the task off of the command-line arguments.
#
shift

# And execute it the upload.
# Stdin and the command-line arguments will be as specified in the marker directory.
#
exec ./$base $argv

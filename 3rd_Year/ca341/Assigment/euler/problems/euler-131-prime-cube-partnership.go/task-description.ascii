= Euler 131

Euler problem 131: https://projecteuler.net/problem=131[].

// //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
== Go

.Task
****
Write a program in Go called `euler-131-prime-cube-partnership.go` that will satisfy the following
There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, 
such that the expression n^3 + n^2(p) is a perfect cube.

For example, when p=19, 8^3 + 8^2(19) = 12^3

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of 
is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

How many primes below the command line input $n$ have this remarkable property?


Upload your solution to https://euler.computing.dcu.ie/einstein/[_Einstein_].

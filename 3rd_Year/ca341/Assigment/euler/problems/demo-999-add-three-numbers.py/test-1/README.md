This is a second test case.

There can be as many additional test cases as you like.

Each should be in a subdirectory of the main task directory, like this one.

This test is different to the one in the directory above in that it uses
a shell-script runner.

This can often be more convenient.

I (SB) like to write my shell scripts in zsh, hence `runner.zsh`, but
you can use bash (`runner.bash`) or dash (`runner.sh`) if you prefer either
of those.
